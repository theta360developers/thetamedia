is also popular. If your viewer supports XMP data, you can edit
the http://lists.theta360.guide/t/getting-360-images-to-work-after-resize-exif-technique/1066[metadata].
For example, in Facebook and most social media applications, simply drag
the default orientation with your mouse.

I will show you a technique to use Hugin. It's not necessarily a best
practice as it's a bit cumbersome. However, this technique may have a
place in your toolbox if your viewer does not support XMP data. This technique
works with any application, even applications that do not support pitch,
yaw, and roll adjustments with XMP data.

==== Facebook Starting Position
To save you time, I'll repeat that you don't need this technique if your
application is uploading a 360 image to Facebook or most social media sites.
Facebook adjusts the XMP data using your mouse to set the default image.
