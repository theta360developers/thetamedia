== Web, Headset, and Mobile Platforms

In addition to social media networks like Facebook, Google Street View,
there are a number of tools, frameworks and platforms to share
THETA images and video.

I'll divide the application into three categories:

1. WebVR (Experimental)
2. Unity
3. JavaScript libraries

=== WebVR

WebVR is an experimental specification for JavaScript APIs. For a status update on WebVR, go to
https://webvr.info/[webvr.info]

A-Frame works on web, mobile, and headsets. It's one of the leading
open source frameworks for WebVR.

You can test a THETA 360 Image Gallery by pointing your phone in landscape
mode to https://360gallery.glitch.me[the sample app]
